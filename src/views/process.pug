            h3.type-geb Great products are not designed by accident.
            p.m-b-xs-0 I'm frequently asked about my design process and the answer typically is 
              span.type-geb it depends.
            br
            p.m-b-xs-0 Instead of a process with strict rules, I think more about it as a framework. There are general guidelines I follow, but I also know when to deviate and get creative—always maintaining a customer first mindset.
            br
            p If you compare my design framework to a code framework, there are multiple correlations:
            ul
              li Flexible framework with a set of guidelines to keep you on track.
              li Easy to scale up or down, depending on the type of project.
              li Assets that can be used as the situation or user needs dictate.
              li Allows for creativity without breaking everything else.
