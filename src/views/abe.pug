                | , Illinois also wanted a solution for their state benefit recipients. Critical benefits such as food stamps, child care and Medicaid were a hassle to apply for and renew.
              p I started by eliminating the bottleneck - providing documentation to the state benefits office. Documents such as a drivers license or pay stubs had to be either hand delivered or faxed in.
              p With the new ABE mobile app, users are able to upload a picture of their document to the benefits office. This prevents the user from delivering the documentation in person.

Texas has opened access to their benefits application, regardless of the users personal technology. The State has paved the way for more States to follow in their footsteps.
