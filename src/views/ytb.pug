              h3 Lead UX designer for the Your Texas Benefits mobile app.
              p Texas receives thousands of applications for state benefits each month. Critical benefits such as food stamps, child care, and Medicaid. Applying for these benefits is long and requires many steps.
              p I started by eliminating the bottleneck - providing documentation to the state benefits office. Documents such as a drivers license or pay stubs had to be either hand delivered or faxed in.
              p With the new Your Texas Benefits mobile app, users are able to upload a picture of their document to the benefits office. This prevents the user from delivering the documentation in person.

              h4 The app is currently expanding with new features, such as the ability to create a new account and edit existing benefits. Texas has opened access to their benefits application, regardless of the user's personal technology. The State has paved the way for more States to follow in their footsteps.
